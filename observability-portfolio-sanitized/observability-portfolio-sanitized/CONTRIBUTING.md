# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this sanitized observability portfolio.

## Guidelines
- Keep everything **sanitized**: no real customer data, account IDs, hostnames, or internal URLs.
- Prefer **templates** with placeholders.
- Add a short `README.md` with assumptions and how to adapt.

## Submitting changes
1. Create a branch
2. Make your updates
3. Ensure examples do not require credentials to read
4. Open a pull request with:
   - what changed
   - why it matters
   - screenshots (optional)
