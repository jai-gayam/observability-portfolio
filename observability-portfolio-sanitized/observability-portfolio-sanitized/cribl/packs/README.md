# Cribl Packs (Sanitized)

This directory contains a **pack skeleton** and patterns you can adapt:
- Routes that classify traffic by source and sourcetype
- Pipelines that normalize fields and apply redaction
- Examples designed to be copy/paste friendly

> Import note: Exact export/import formats vary by Cribl version and deployment. Treat these as templates.
